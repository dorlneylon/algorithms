## Done list
- Splay Trees
- Fast Fourier Transform: I've decided to leave my implementation [here](https://gist.github.com/dorlneylon/7f8f3400b89a09df553ea47877be8451) to not overburden the repository with 3 implementations. 
- Karatsuba
- Treaps
- Sparse tables
- Segment trees
- Fenwick tree
- Bellman-Ford
- Dijkstra
